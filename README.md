# Discord-Game-Bot
Discord bot that allows two users to play Tic-Tac-Toe with each other. The bot was made using 
Hikari which is an API for creating Discord bots. After a player makes a move, the board is 
displayed and the bot checks for a winner and tells the users if the game is over. There are 
additional commands to request the current player, view the game board, and reset the game.
